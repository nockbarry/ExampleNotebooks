# ExampleNotebooks

This is a repository containing some jupyter notebooks that I used to explore various concepts in classification and model training.
A subset of nonlinear data classifier methods.ipynb is displayed on a webpage that displays the animation of the decision boundaries for Neural Networks of various sizes during training. You can find the webpage here:
Neural Network Model Performance Across Datasets

The rest of the notebook explores other classifcation methods on the same data.
